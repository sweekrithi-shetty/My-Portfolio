# Simple Portfolio

A simple portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing my projects and skills as a developer.

## Description

This is a straightforward portfolio website that I created to showcase my coding projects and highlight my skills as a developer. The website is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.


## Usage

Once the portfolio website is up and running, you can navigate through the different sections to explore my projects, view project details, and learn more about my skills and experience. The website is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing visitors to easily browse and interact with the content.

Feel free to customize the website to reflect your own projects and skills. Update the `index.html` file with your own content and modify the CSS styles in the `styles.css` file to suit your preferences.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to enhance this portfolio website. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, please submit them as pull requests. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposed changes.
